## Overview

This repository contains a complete solution for detecting fake and spam news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. The project employs a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM neural network to classify news articles as fake or true, using large, real-world datasets. Model interpretability and practical deployment are core features, with an interactive web application for live article analysis.

## Introduction

The rapid spread of online news has increased the risk of misinformation and fake stories. Traditional manual fact-checking is slow and unscalable, motivating the need for automated fake news detection. This project leverages deep learning and NLP to develop a robust, transparent, and user-friendly system for automated news credibility assessment.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM Model:** Combines convolutional layers for feature extraction and bidirectional LSTM for context.
- **Text Preprocessing & Visualization:** Cleans data and creates word clouds to visualize language patterns.
- **Model Interpretability:** Highlights important words influencing model predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and standard metrics.
- **Web Application:** Interactive user interface for real-time news article analysis.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Publicly available fake news datasets (e.g., LIAR, FakeNewsNet, Kaggle competitions)
- **Format:** CSV with news text and labels (fake/true)
- **Note:** Download the datasets and place them in the `data/` directory.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preparation:** Download and clean labeled news articles.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize class balance and article lengths.
3. **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and padding.
4. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Embedding Layer:** Dense vector representation of tokens.
   - **1D CNN Layer:** Local n-gram feature extraction.
   - **Bidirectional LSTM Layer:** Contextual, sequential information.
   - **Dense Output:** Final classification.
5. **Interpretability:** Feature importance via logistic regression and attention.
6. **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, ROC curve, accuracy, and F1 score.
7. **Deployment:** Web app for user-facing predictions.
